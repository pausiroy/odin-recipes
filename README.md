My current project is building a basic recipes website.

So far I have learned how to create a basic barebones website containing a header and body. I managed to show the title of the website on the browser and add a picture of a dog. It doesn't seem much but I'm treating it as a small achievement. It makes me salute and respect all the interactive websites I've visited and looked at them from a different angle.

By the end of this lesson I can proudly say I learned how to build a small foundation on a simple website.
